# Question-Answering Model

The objective of this webapp is to display the correct answer to a question asked by a user, using a given context using pretrained models from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/models?pipeline_tag=question-answering). The user can either enter the question and context manually, or choose to upload a csv file with the question, context and model name, and the answer will be displayed. In addition to answering a question, the user is also able to input their model of choice to answer their question, delete a model from the database, and view all available models.
